Game Maps
Game maps are a fundamental part of video games and are usually loaded into memory at the beginning of a level. This loading process often happens when the player sees a “Load” or “Loading” screen at the start of a level. A game map contains the structural data of the level and defines how the environment is organized and rendered during gameplay.
Most game maps are traditionally two-dimensional (2D), representing the layout of the level using a grid or tile system. These 2D maps store information about rooms, platforms, or repetitive tiles (mosaics), where X and Y coordinates are used to define positions within the level. This approach is very common in classic games and modern 2D platformers.
In addition to 2D maps, many games also use three-dimensional (3D) maps. These maps can represent rooms, platforms, and environments in full 3D space, using X, Y, and Z coordinates. Even in some platform games, 3D tiled maps are used to create repetitive rooms and platforms while maintaining efficient memory usage.
Game maps may also include dynamic elements such as characters, enemies, items, or objects that represent lives, points, or power-ups. These elements are often updated in real time during gameplay. For example, when an enemy is defeated or an object is collected, the map data is modified at runtime to reflect these changes.
Overall, game maps play a crucial role in level design, performance, and gameplay logic, serving as the foundation on which the entire game world is built.
